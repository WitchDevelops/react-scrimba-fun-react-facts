# Tech stack

* Vite
* React
* TypeScript

# Some fun solutions

* rendering the list of items from external data file

# Live

Deployed to Netlify [here](https://scrimba-fun-react-facts.netlify.app/)

# Motivation

I decided to go off-platform because it's so much better for practice, and wanted to use TypeScript - to practice using it in my projects.
